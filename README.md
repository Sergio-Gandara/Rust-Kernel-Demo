# Rust-Kernel-Demo
A demo of a basic kernel written in rust to learn more about OS programming. 
This project could not have been attempted without the crucial guidelines of a certain amazing blog post (https://os.phil-opp.com), credit and many thanks to its creator, as it allowed me to dive right into this subject.

There are several modifications on the original rust kernel iniciative, due to errors found at the time of coding, and solutions have been attempted. If anyone encounters similar problems to those describe in the documentation inside the folders, maybe some of the solutions proposed serve of some use. As this is not as popular as other programming topics not many (if any) information is found online.
